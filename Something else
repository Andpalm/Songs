A-look-a-there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else
Hey look-a there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else
Hey look-a here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
We'll look real sharp with the white top down
I'll keepâ€¦
